- Once you have installed XAMPP or WAMP, you must download this project and place it in the htdocs directory. The htdocs folder can be located in the XAMPP or WAMP folder.
- After this, you should start the Apache and MySQL server. You can do that by ticking on the start button in the XAMPP or WAMP control panel.
